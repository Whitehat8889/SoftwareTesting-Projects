## Introduction

Software testing is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle. It ensures that applications function as intended and meet user expectations. This repository serves as a resource for testers, developers, and anyone interested in quality assurance. 

## Project Overview

This repository includes projects in three main areas:

1. **E-commerce Testing**: 
   - Tools: Jira + Xray
   - Focus: Validate user flows, payment processing, and product listings.
  
2. **Banking App Testing**: 
   - Tools: TestMonitor
   - Focus: Test security, transaction processing, and user authentication.

3. **API Testing**: 
   - Tools: Postman
   - Focus: Validate API endpoints, response formats, and error handling.

Each project contains detailed documentation to guide you through the testing processes, including specific test cases and design techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Jira**: A popular project management tool for bug tracking and agile project management.
- **Xray**: A Jira plugin that enhances test management capabilities.
- **TestMonitor**: A test management tool that helps in organizing and tracking test cases.
- **Postman**: A tool for API testing that allows you to send requests and analyze responses.

### E-commerce Testing

This section includes test cases that cover various aspects of an E-commerce platform, such as:

- User Registration
- Product Search
- Shopping Cart Functionality
- Payment Processing

### Banking App Testing

In this section, you will find test cases focused on:

- User Authentication
- Transaction Processing
- Account Management

### API Testing

This section covers API endpoints and includes test cases for:

- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Authentication
- Error Handling

## Testing Techniques

Testing techniques are essential for creating effective test cases. Here are some techniques used in this repository:

1. **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divides input data into equivalent partitions to reduce the number of test cases.
  
2. **Boundary Value Analysis**: Focuses on testing the boundaries between partitions.
  
3. **Decision Table Testing**: Uses a table to represent combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs.
  
4. **State Transition Testing**: Tests the system's response to state changes.

5. **Exploratory Testing**: Involves exploring the application without predefined test cases to find defects.
